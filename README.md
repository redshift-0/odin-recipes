Basic recipe website

This project has a main index page with links to a few recipes.

The project demonstrates my knowledge of HTML. Namely:
 - making boilerplate;
 - using basic html elements with according tags;
 - creating and linking webpages
 - other miscelaneous stuff.

 All recipes are taken from https://www.allrecipes.com/ and images are taken from Google image search.
