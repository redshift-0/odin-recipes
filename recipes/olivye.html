        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This Russian salad recipe is what my mom and grandmother make every time there's a family gathering or a special occasion. Leave out the ham to make this a vegetarian dish. The potatoes, carrots, and eggs do not have to be completely chilled after boiling.
